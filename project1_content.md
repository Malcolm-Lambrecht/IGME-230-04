# Temple Survival

## Concept
***
A top down game where the player will have to react quickly in order to dodge an increasing number of projectiles coming from off screen.

## Genre
***
The game falls into the avoidance category.

## Platform
***
It will be available on desktop only.

## Story
***
The goal is to survive as long as possible in order to earn coins which are used to purchase upgrades for the next play through.
It will be themed as an adventurer dodging arrows/fireballs etc. in a jungle temple.

## Esthetics
***
Because there will be so many things on screen at once a simple/cartoon style will be used so it will be easy to tell whats going on when it gets chaotic.
Similarly the backgound music will not feature heavily but sound effects will be used to give the player a heads up about incoming obstacles.

## Gameplay
***
### Mechanics
The player will be on some kind of platform while various things are launched at them. Different things will require different dodging strategies from the player. The goal is to survive as long as possible for a higher score.

### Control
The player's character will follow the mouse around the screen.

### Onboarding
There will be a breif tutorial at the begining of the game. In addition the game starts slowly and introduces new obstacles over time to allow the player to become used to new mechanics.

### Player learning
In between games the player can purchase upgrades that come in the form of items. The player will only be able to take a limited number of items into each game.
The items may have effects such as
-Increased movement speed
-Resistance to a type of obstacle 
-A temporary shield
-A coin multiplier

Any items would be designed to either make an aspect of the game easier or increase rewards earned for a playthrough.

## About the developer

I'm a second year Game Design and Development major. My programming experience is mostly c# but I have just a little bit of javascript experiance as well.
I'm interested in AI, procedural generation, and multiplayer and enjoy learning about them.
